# OLADOSU ENIOLA EMMANUEL- Data Analysis Portfolio
## About
Hello there! My name is Oladosu Eniola Emmanuel and I recently graduated from school. I have a passion, for the field of data analysis. I have an understanding of SQL, Python, R, data visualization statistical analysis and machine learning. I'm excited to use these skills to gain insights from data. 
Throughout my journey I've gained the knowledge and motivation to tackle problems. Now I'm thrilled to showcase my projects on GitHub. You can explore how I creatively analyze data and contribute to making decisions based on it.
In my GitHub repository you'll find a collection of projects that demonstrate my expertise and enthusiasm in data analysis. From manipulating databases to building models cleaning up data and performing analytics â€“ I aim to show you the wide range of skills that I possess. Lets dive into the world of data together as we uncover its stories and unlock its immense potential for innovation and positive change, in various fields.
This repository serves to showcase my skills and as a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.

Within this section, I'll share links to my GitHub repositories where you can find code and Jupyter notebooks I've developed while either taking online courses or simply indulging in data and code exploration.
### Python-for-Data-Analysis-NumPy
#### Description: 
NumPy (or Numpy) is a Linear Algebra Library for Python, the reason it is so important for Data Science with Python is that almost all of the libraries in the PyData Ecosystem rely on NumPy as one of their main building blocks.
Numpy is also incredibly fast, as it has bindings to C libraries. For more info on why you would want to use Arrays instead of lists, check out this great [StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/993984/why-numpy-instead-of-python-lists). You will only learn the basics of NumPy, to get started we need to install it!
#### Repository:

Status: Completed in June 2023 (please, check the certificates section below).

  

## Certificates
In my perspective, the most effective method of demonstrating one's skills is through hands-on experience and sharing the results, with certificates often being an indirect outcome. Consequently, I've compiled a list of my certifications, arranged in reverse-chronological order and accompanied by their respective completion dates.
